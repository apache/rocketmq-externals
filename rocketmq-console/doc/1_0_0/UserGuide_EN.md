## Access Console with HTTPS
* SpringBoot itself has provided the SSL configuration. You can use the project test Keystore:resources/rmqcngkeystore.jks. The store is generated with the following unix keytool commands:
```
#Generate Keystore and add alias rmqcngKey
keytool -genkeypair -alias rmqcngKey  -keyalg RSA -validity 3650 -keystore rmqcngkeystore.jks 
#View keystore content
keytool -list -v -keystore rmqcngkeystore.jks 
#Transfer type as official 
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore rmqcngkeystore.jks -destkeystore rmqcngkeystore.jks -deststoretype pkcs12 
```

* Uncomment the following SSL properties in resources/application.properties. restart Console then access with HTTPS.

```
#Set https port
server.port=8443

### SSL setting
server.ssl.key-store=classpath:rmqcngkeystore.jks
server.ssl.key-store-password=rocketmq
server.ssl.keyStoreType=PKCS12
server.ssl.keyAlias=rmqcngkey
```

## Login/Logout on Console
Access Console with username and password and logout to leave the console。To stage the function on, we need the steps below:

* 1.Turn on the property in resources/application.properties.
```$xslt
# open the login func
rocketmq.config.loginRequired=true

# Directory of ashboard & login user configure file 
rocketmq.config.dataPath=/tmp/rocketmq-console/data
```
* 2.Make sure the directory defined in property ${rocketmq.config.dataPath} exists and the file "users.properties" is created under it. 
The console system will use the resources/users.properties by default if a customized file is not found。

The format in the content of users.properties:
```$xslt
# This file supports hot change, any change will be auto-reloaded without Console restarting.
# Format: a user per line, username=password[,N] #N is optional, 0 (Normal User); 1 (Admin)

# Define Admin
admin=admin,1

# Define Normal users
user1=user1
user2=user2
```
* 3.Restart Console Application after above configuration setting well.  


## Permission Control
If the login function is enabled when a user accesses the Console, the user controls the access permission of the interface based on the login role.

* 1.Turn on the property in resources/application.properties.
```$xslt
# open the login func
rocketmq.config.loginRequired=true

# Directory of ashboard & login user configure file 
rocketmq.config.dataPath=/tmp/rocketmq-console/data
```
* 2.Make sure the directory defined in property ${rocketmq.config.dataPath} exists and the file "role-permission.yml" is created under it. 
The console system will use the resources/role-permission.yml by default if a customized file is not found。

The format in the content of role-permission.yml:
```$xslt
# This file supports hot change, any change will be auto-reloaded without Console restarting.
# Format: To add or delete interface permissions, add or delete interface addresses from the list.

# ordinary user
rolePerms:
  ordinary:
    - /rocketmq/nsaddr
    - /ops/homepage.query
    - /cluster/list.query
    - /cluster/brokerConfig.query
    - /dashboard/broker.query
    - /dashboard/topic.query
    - /dashboard/topicCurrent
    ....
```
* 3.On the front page, operation buttons such as deleting and updating resources are not displayed for common users in order to better distinguish the rights of common users and admin users.
