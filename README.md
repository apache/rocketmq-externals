# [Apache RocketMQ](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq) Community Projects Home

There are many of the Apache RocketMQ external projects, which is born from [Apache RocketMQ Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/wiki/RocketMQ-Improvement-Proposal) and contributed and maintained by community. The PMC will lean towards developer community support, to help discovery and initial steps towards incubation in the external repository. Incubator Projects could graduate if they meet the following requirements.

 * Require 3+1 vote from the PMC.
 * Used successfully in production by at least three independent end users which, in the PMC judgement, are of adequate quality and scope.
 * Have a healthy number of committers.

## Contribution

We are always very happy to have contributions, whether for trivial cleanups or big new features. We want to have high quality, well documented codes for each programming language, as well as the surrounding ecosystem of integration tools that people use with RocketMQ.

Nor is code the only way to contribute to the project. We strongly value documentation, integration with other project, and gladly accept improvements for these aspects.
